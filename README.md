# School Assignments

This repository contains my coursework and lab projects for various computer science classes.  
It includes assignments, labs, and practice exercises across multiple courses, ranging from introductory programming (COP3502C) to more advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Folders are organized by class and by individual lab/project for easy reference.

> Note: Some folders may contain starter code, completed assignments, or examples for learning purposes.
